		[[params.faq.questions]]

		[[params.faq.questions]]

		id = "03"

   		[[params.faq.questions]]
   		question = "What is Archivematica?"
   		answer = "[Archivematica](https://www.archivematica.org/en/) is an open-source tool for processing digital objects for preservation and access, including born-digital and digitized content. Archivematica is developed and maintained by Artefactual Systems Inc. Its primary function is to process data using a series of linked tasks called microservices to create Archival Information Packages (AIPs) for preservation and Dissemination Information Packages (DIPs) for access. It performs actions using a centralized Format Policy Registry (FPR) that is fully customizable based on institutional preferences. Archivematica integrates many individual open source tools for digital preservation tasks, such as file format identification, characterization, validation and normalization, into a single workflow."
		id = "04"

   		[[params.faq.questions]]
   		question = "What does an Archival Information Package (AIP) consist of?"
   		answer = "An AIP consists of the original data objects to be preserved and other materials that made up the original transfer, optionally normalized copies of data objects in preservation-friendly formats, submission documentation, logs, and a METS-based XML file describing the package’s contents, the relationships between these contents, and the actions performed on the contents as part of the Archivematica workflow."
		id = "05"

   		[[params.faq.questions]]
   		question = "What does a Dissemination Information Package (DIP) consist of?"

		id = "06"

		[[params.faq.questions]]
		question = "What other tools does Permafrost provide?"

		id = "07"

		[[params.faq.questions]]
		question = "What onboarding resources are provided?"
		answer = "Onboarding with the service includes an initial needs assessment interview to benchmark the participant's current capacity, document their needs, and set goals for uses of the service. This interview is followed by an introductory training session. Additional onboarding consultation lasts for the first twelve weeks of service use, and includes consultation on settings, transfer structure, metadata entry, access workflows, file format policies, and validation of stored AIPs and DIPs."

		id = "10"

		[[params.faq.questions]]
		question = "Is Archivematica an access system or repository?"
		answer = "No. Its main function is to produce well-formed data packages suitable for long-term preservation. It is not intended for end-users such as students or researchers and does not store the packages itself, though packages are searchable and downloadable through the interface. Hence, it must be connected to independent storage, which is why it pairs beautifully with the [Ontario Library Research Cloud](https://cloud.scholarsportal.info), which provides access to secure, affordable and reliable storage. <br><br> On the access side, metadata about a stored AIP can be uploaded to [Access to Memory (AtoM)](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/) instances as part of the Permafrost service, and several integration options are available for locally-hosted AtoM instances.<br><br> Integrations with different access systems or repositories as transfer sources for data are also possible. [Contact us](#contact) for more information."

   		[[params.faq.questions]]
   		question = "If I want to get my data out, can I?"
   		answer = "Absolutely. Permafrost does not keep your data within any proprietary system - AIPs are stored outside of the Archivematica application itself and your use of the Permafrost service is not locked in. However, systems-created data such as indexes cannot be extracted for users, though this can be re-generated from the stored AIPs themselves."
		id = "15"

		[[params.faq.questions]]
   		question = "How secure is Permafrost?"
   		answer = "Archivematica instances are installed, hosted, and maintained by Scholars Portal on CentOS-based virtual machines installed on hardware at the University of Toronto Libraries’ data centre and supported by our systems team. Access to Archivematica instances are limited by OCUL member IP ranges and secured via SSL and user logins.<br><br>Upload and download to and from the OLRC is also secured by SSL. On the OLRC itself, network nodes in the storage cloud are connected through ORION, the high-speed research network that is supported by Ontario’s universities. Data is transferred between nodes over a private network within the ORION infrastructure.<br><br>All data centres involved in the service are restricted to IT staff and have intrusion detection systems (IDS) in place. Data centres implement standard security controls, including the use of firewalls, to limit inbound and outbound traffic to specific ports and from specific domains."
		id = "16"

   		[[params.faq.questions]]
   		question = "What is the difference between hardware sizes?"
   		answer = "Archivematica runs on virtual machines that are hosted at Scholars Portal. The size of the hardware required relates to the size and quantity of files to be processed, so subscribers should have a good sense of extent the materials they intend to process. A Level 1 machine is most comfortably used for packages in the 0-50 GB range and consisting of fewer than 500 files. A Level 2 machine will be able to process larger-sized transfers of 50-250 GB and is recommended for organizations with greater quantities of audio and video or greater quantities of files. Part of the onboarding process will involve assessing what machine is right for your needs."
