		id = "01"

		[[params.faq.questions]]
   		question = "What services does Scholars Portal provide as part of Permafrost?"
   		answer = "Scholars Portal provides:<br><br> - Setup, installation and maintenance of Archivematica instance(s) <br>- Initial onboarding, testing and setup support, including a readiness interview/consultation and introductory training session <br>- Ongoing technical troubleshooting support<br>- Training resources, guides and tools<br>- Reporting data on stored packages<br>-Assistance with performing preservation actions over time."
		id = "02"

		[[params.faq.questions]]
   		question = "What are the responsibilities of the subscribing institution?"
   		answer = "The preserving institution:<br><br> - Determines the scope and structure of content to be preserved<br> - Actively uses the service to process digital content through the workflow<br> - Resources and manages staff use of, and access to, the service<br> - Determines preservation policies and procedures with input from Scholars Portal where requested<br> - Validates outputs against internal or external standards Initiates preservation actions over time"
		id = "03"

   		[[params.faq.questions]]
   		question = "What is Archivematica?"
   		answer = "<a href='https://www.archivematica.org/en/' target='_blank'>Archivematica</a> is an open-source tool for processing digital archival materials for long-term preservation and access, including born-digital and digitized content. Archivematica is developed and maintained by Artefactual Systems Inc. Its primary function is to process data using a series of linked tasks called microservices to create Archival Information Packages (AIPs) for preservation and Dissemination Information Packages (DIPs) for access. It performs actions using a centralized Format Policy Registry (FPR) that is fully customizable based on institutional preferences. Archivematica integrates many individual open source tools for digital preservation tasks, such as file format identification, characterization, validation and normalization, into a single workflow."
		id = "04"

   		[[params.faq.questions]]
   		question = "What does an Archival Information Package (AIP) consist of?"
   		answer = "An AIP consists of the original data objects and other materials that make up the original transfer, optionally normalized copies of data objects in preservation-friendly formats, submission documentation, logs, and a METS XML file describing the packageâ€™s contents, the relationships between these contents, and the actions performed on the contents as part of the Archivematica workflow."
		id = "05"

   		[[params.faq.questions]]
   		question = "What does a Dissemination Information Package (DIP) consist of?"
   		answer = "A DIP consists of access copies normalized according to rules set in Archivematica (such as a medium-sized jpg file created from a large tif file), thumbnails, and a copy of the METS file."
		id = "06"

		[[params.faq.questions]]
		question = "What other tools does Permafrost provide?"
		answer = "Permafrost provides lightweight tools for making Archivematica-friendly CSV files for descriptive metadata import and access to tools related to the OLRC, such as Swiftbrowser, a browser-based method of transfering data into Archivematica and accessing stored packages. Additional tools are in development."
		id = "07"

		[[params.faq.questions]]
		question = "What onboarding resources are provided?"
		answer = "Onboarding with the service includes an initial needs assessment interview to benchmark the participant's current capacity, document their needs, and set goals for uses of the service. This interview is followed by an introductory training session. Additional onboarding consultation lasts for the first twelve weeks of service use, and includes consultation on settings, transfer structure, metadata entry, connections to AtoM, file format policies, and validation of stored AIPs and DIPs."
		id = "08"

		[[params.faq.questions]]

		id = "10"

		[[params.faq.questions]]
		question = "Is Archivematica an access system or repository?"
		answer = "No. Its main function is to produce well-formed data packages. It is not intended for end-users such as students or researchers and does not store the packages itself, though packages are accessible through the interface. Hence, it must be connected to independent storage, which is why it pairs beautifully with the <a href='https://cloud.scholarsportal.info' target='_blank'>OLRC</a>, which provides access to secure, affordable and reliable storage. <br><br> However, integration with locally-hosted instances of <a href='https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/' target='_blank'>AccesstoMemory (AtoM)</a> is part of the service. AtoM integration allows the deposit of digital objects and metadata in an AtoM instance, which is intended for use by the public to access archival descriptions and digital objects."
		id = "11"

   		[[params.faq.questions]]
   		question = "What storage options do I have?"
   		answer = "The default storage space is the <a href='https://cloud.scholarsportal.info' target='_blank'>Ontario Library Research Cloud</a>, which provides secure and affordable storage replicated across three nodes in Ontario. Permafrost users do not have to be OLRC subscribers. Other storage integrations are possible at extra cost in consultation with Scholars Portal."

   		[[params.faq.questions]]
   		question = "If I want to get my data out, can I?"
   		answer = "Absolutely. Permafrost does not keep your data within any proprietary system - data is stored outside of the Archivematica itself and your use of the Permafrost service is not locked in. However, systems-created data such as indexes cannot be extracted for users, though this can be easily re-generated from the stored AIPs themselves."
		id = "15"

   		[[params.faq.questions]]
   		question = "What is the difference between hardware sizes?"
   		answer = "Archivematica runs on virtual machines that are hosted on servers at Scholars Portal. Not all institutions need a full-capacity machine running at all times. A large machine will be able to process larger-sized transfers or transfers with many files more quickly. A medium sized machine is suitable for transfers up to 5 GB in size. A small machine is suitable for transfers under 1 GB."
