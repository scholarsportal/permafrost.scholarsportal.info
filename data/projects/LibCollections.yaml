description: "Permafrost is a great fit for libraries looking to preserve digital collections in libraries, whether they are born-digital or digitized materials.<br><br>

Over the past several decades, libraries have undertaken many large-scale digitization projects across many media types, including textual materials such as theses, photographs collections, audiovisual materials, and more. All of these valuable digital materials represent a significant investment of time and effort, and therefore require proper preservation to ensure their future viability, whether through robust metadata and file format validation, customizable normalization to preservation-friendly formats, or the creation of access copies in formats suitable for users.<br><br>

The creation and capture of born-digital library materials are also now a day-to-day process for most libraries. These include theses and dissertations; web archiving projects; collections from government, map and data libraries; and more.<br><br>

Integration with library digital repositories such as DSpace is also available at extra cost."
