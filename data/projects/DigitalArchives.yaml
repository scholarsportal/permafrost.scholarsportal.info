description: "Permafrost has been designed for the use of archives and special collections units who are increasingly called to preserve born-digital materials received from donors or transferring units.<br><br>

The tools and services that make up Permafrost will assist archives in achieving capacity for processing digital donations for long-term preservation and access. This includes processes for creating metadata to accompany digital objects into the future, advice on file format policies and normalization rules, and tools for ongoing maintenance and monitoring.<br><br>

Integration with locally-hosted instances of AtoM using the [metadata upload function](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.6/user-manual/access/access/#upload-metadata-to-atom) is also available. Full digital object access copy upload workflows to AtoM are in testing."
